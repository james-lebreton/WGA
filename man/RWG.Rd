\title{RWG: Within-Group Agreement}
\usage{
RWG(x, grpid, model, scale, reset = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Item on which to estimate RWG}

\item{grpid}{Grouping/clustering variable}

\item{model}{User-supplied description of multilevel measurement model (e.g., consensus)}

\item{scale}{Minimum and Maximum Values of the Scale}

\item{reset}{Logical option for handling negative estimates of RWG;
FALSE retains negative values; TRUE resets values to 0}
}
\value{
List containing a matrix of the null error values, estimates of RWG, and
        summary of how many negative values were obtained
}
\description{
This function estimates James, Demaree, & Wolf's (1984) within-group agreement statistic
for a single item, denoted rwg.
}
\details{
The input consists of a data frame, and the names of the grouping variable and item.
The output consists of a data frame containing the group names, the variance within each group, and
estimates of rwg based on multiple null response distributions (see LeBreton and Senter, 2008).
