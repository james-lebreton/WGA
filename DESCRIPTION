Title: WGA: Within-Group Agreement & Data Aggregation
Version: 0.1.1
Author: James M. LeBreton
Maintainer: James M. LeBreton <jlebreto@gmail.com>
Description: This package uses the acronym WGA to stand for 'Within-Group Agreement & Aggregation'
             This package includes functions to aggregate data nested in lower-level 
             units (e.g., individuals) to higher-level units (e.g., work groups). These functions
             not only aggregate data (aggregate.data) but merge the newly created aggregate-level
             variables with the original data frame.  In addition, there are functions for estimating
             a range of different within-group (i.e., within-unit)  agreement statistics
             that are frequently used by multilevel researchers to justify data aggregation (rwg, awg, AD).
